# Floyd–Warshall algorithm

## Application background
The user input the exchange rates between 2 currencies in an exchange.  The rate of the same currency between 2 exchanges is set to 1.0 by default.  Then a graph is formed by vertices presenting the exchange/currency pairs and the edges connecting the vertices are exchange rates.  That's the problem applicable by the Floyd–Warshall algorithm.  The goal is looking for the best rate between 2 currencies and trades involved between the exchange/currency pairs.

### User input for exchange rates
User input the rates in the following format
```
<timestamp> <exchange> <source_currency> <destination_currency> <forward_rate> <backward_rate>
```
E.g.
```
2017-11-01T09:42:23+00:00 KRAKEN BTC USD 1000.0 0.0009
```
It means at Kraken, 1 BTC can be traded for 1000.0 USD and 1 USD can be traded for 0.0009

Continuous entering rates will form a graph.
E.g.
```
2017-11-01T09:42:23+00:00 KRAKEN BTC USD 1000.0 0.0009
2017-11-01T09:43:23+00:00 GDAX BTC USD 1001.0 0.0008
```
As mentioned before, rate of 1.0 is assigned for the same currency across different exchanges.  The following graph is formed.

### User input for the best rate
The input format is:
```
<source_exchange> <source_currency> <destination_exchange> <destination_currency>
```
E.g. 
```
KRAKEN BTC GDAX USD
```
The system is expected to return
```
BEST_RATES_BEGIN KRAKEN BTC GDAX USD 1001.1
KRAKEN BTC
GDAX BTC
GDAX USD
BEST_RATES_END
```

## Algebraic Data Types
* `Vertex` represents the exchange and currency.
* `RateEntry` contains the starting vertex, the list of vertices representing the trades involves from the starting vertex, the best rate between the starting vertex and the last vertex of the list.
* `Matrix` holds `RateEntry`s for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
* `AppState` which is either `InSync` or `OutSync`.  It applies the FSM concept.  `InSync` means the matrix is optimized with the latest cache `ExchRateTimes` that holds the user input exchange rates.  When the cache is updated with the rate update request, the matrix is no longer valid such that it should update `AppState` as `OutSync`.  In processing the best rate request, it uses the `AppState` to decide whether it should re-run the algorithm to optimize the matrix.  If it is `InSync`, it will not waste the time to re-run the algorithm.  Otherwise, it will re-run the algorithm and update `AppState` as `InSync`.

## Build application
* Under `floydWarshall` folder, to enter the nix shell, run `nix-shell`
* Under the nix shell, run `cabal build`

## Run application
* Under the nix shell, run `cabal run`
* Please refer to the "Appendix" section for details.

## Run unit-tests
* Under the nix shell, to build the tests, run `cabal new-build test:tests`
* To run the tests, run `cabal new-test test:tests`
